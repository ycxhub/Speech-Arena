# Research and Recency

When implementation, design, or advice depends on external APIs, libraries, docs, or practices:

1. **Perform a web search** for the latest information before relying on it. Do not assume in-memory or training knowledge is current.
2. **Treat the current year as 2026** when checking recency (e.g., search for "2026" or "2025" where 2026 results are sparse).
3. **Prefer official docs and recent articles** (current year or prior year) over older posts.

Apply this when:
- Integrating third-party SDKs (e.g., Supabase, Next.js, Cloudflare R2).
- Following setup guides, env vars, or API signatures.
- Implementing security, auth, or deployment steps.
- Recommending versions, flags, or patterns that may have changed.
